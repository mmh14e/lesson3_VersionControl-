            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is an extremely important in the computer world. The whole idea of file sharing revolves around a version control server. This is known as a repository where all the files for a particular project are stored. Once uploaded onto the server team members can work separately on the files and resave them to the server. This allows multiple people to work on a project from the comfort of their own computer on their own time. VCS machines provide a descriptive history on when the files were altered and who made the changes. Besides a descriptive history files stored on a VCS cannot be overwritten and there is always the ability to restore an older version of the project. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a very important type of a version control system used in developing projects. The difference and really perk of GIT is that each user has their own copies of the project on their own machine. Once shared GIT technology shows the specific area and differences between two users working on the same file. GIT also takes snap chats of a project each time it is saved in order to build a portfolio of all the changes made over time. When the user is finished they can see all the snapshots over time and be able to stage the project and then permanently save. This entire process is all possible through the GIT language that I will discuss further down on this page.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT commands as mentioned before are very important in the development process. It is very crucial to know GIT commands and what changes you can make to files. These commands essentially run the entire process from your personal terminal simply by typing words. The GIT systems through out the process store snapshots of the entire process at every save. A local user can then use basic GIT commands to pull these stored snapshots back to the developing area. Files can then be changed and re-organized by one user using an array of commands, which include git init, git add, git status, and git commit. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote and local repositories are essential parts in the version control system process. During version control team members have the ability to edit a project’s content on their local computers, while sharing those changes with other members. The remote repository is what allows this process to occur by being a shared repository among a number of local repositories. Information from team members is pushed from their local repository to the remote repository. Once information is stored in the remote repository other team members can bring them to their local repository and make changes to what others have created. The three key words to remember when pushing files to a remote repository are add, push, commit! </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GITHUB!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The final main topic that I found important in this lesson is Github. This is an online resource that hosts people’s projects in repositories online. Github can be used for situations like this class or in the future in more professional situations for project management. The first step to sharing your files on this website is creating a repository. This repository allows a person to upload all the files needed for a project onto the website for further development. From there GIT commands like pull and commit requests aid in editing and adding additional information to the files. Github makes file sharing and collaboration simple by allowing all this information to be in one shared space! </p>
